Airtable App - Bases compare
===

The goal of this app is to compare multiple Airtable bases together to detect differences between structure or configuration.

For instance, it can be used to detect whether a base has a table that another base doesn't have.

It is very useful if you run similar bases that should eventually be sync with one another, in order to know what's not identical.

Common use cases are:
- staging/production bases where staging is ahead of production (but eventually gets caught)
- SaaS where each customer has its own base

> The ultimate goal would be to compare an unlimited amount of bases together, but the v1 will try to make it work for comparing 2 bases for starters.
